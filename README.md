## Virtual Machines

The VMs can be managed on https://ui.hpccloud.surfsara.nl/.

## Server Scripts

The AHN3 data is downloaded and re-gridded to make the size of each tile small enough to work with. The re-gridded tiles are then normalised and the features are extracted.

### General Scripts

### Normalisation Scripts

Normalising a pointcloud means the height of the groundlevel is subtracted from the height of each point, such that the _z_-coordinate of each point refers to the height-above-ground. This can be done using the _pdal_ library, which includes from information in its documentation: https://pdal.io/stages/filters.hag.html.
